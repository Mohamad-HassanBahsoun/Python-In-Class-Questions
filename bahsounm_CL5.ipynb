    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will be implementing a set of functions used in conjunction to form a website login system. Your system will utilize a text file for storing, retrieving, and verifying user credentials. We identify users based on their **username** and **password**. For simplicity we assume that usernames and passwords only contain alphanumeric characters. Alphanumeric characters represent the numbers **0-9** and the letters **A-Z** (both uppercase and lowercase). Usernames and passwords are case sensitive and must contain **at least 6** characters. Usernames must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each username and password combination will be stored on its own line in the text file. Each line in the text file has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\texttt{username\\tpassword\\n}\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "More explicitly, each line in the text file will contain a user’s username, a tab character, and that user’s password followed by the newline character. Please note that when opening the text file for viewing you will not explicitly see the **\\t** and **\\n** characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In your implementation, usernames and passwords will be stored as plain text. This means that all usernames and passwords can easily be compromised if access to the text file is provided. This is extremely dangerous in the real world and poses huge security issues. In practicality, passwords are encrypted before stored so that they are not easily identifiable in the event of a data breach. Thus, please do not use any real passwords when developing and testing your program. \n",

    "Question 1: If datbase file in the createUser function were to write instead of append, then everytime we created a new user it it would delete all the exisiting usernames and passwords. And it will keep doing so everytime you add a new user. It is possible for this function to be re-written such that the functionality does not change. What will need to be done is, the file must be open for reading and the contents of the file saved to a string. Then we open the file again but this time is write mode where we write the new content to the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: In the createUser function is where you would use the validLength function. The validLength function would take the username, and the password and check there lengths using the len() function. This will return how many characters the username and password contain. Then we check if both lengths are greater than 6 characters, if it is we return True, if not false. Now in the createUser function you would pass this in. First it checks if validLength is true, if it is then it checks if the username entered exists or not. If all checks out then the new user will be created.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: The encrypt function would be used in the createUser function. When the user goes to create their account, before the password is written into the database file, it is sent to the encrpt function where it will be encrypted. The return value is the encrypted password and this is what will be written into the database file. The decrypt function is what will be used in the login function. When the user enters their username and password we will check the index the username is stored in to get its coresponding encrypted password, then we take this password and run it through the decrypt function, which will return the decrypted password and if it matches the password that the user entered then the login is successfull\n",
