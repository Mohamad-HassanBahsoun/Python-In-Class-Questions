    "In this assignment you will be implementing a product verification system for a company that manufactures smartphones. Your system will determine if a given smartphone passed quality assurance testing in order for the smartphone to be deemed sellable on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "All smartphones undergo two quality assurance tests, namely **T1** and **T2**. The product and testing information will be provided to your system in a **list of lists** where each sub-list represents a unique product accompanied with its T1 and T2 test scores and test dates. Each sub-list has the following format:\n",

    "Question 1: It does not have to be a for loop, there are other methods of obtaing the same results. it is very beneficial for us to use a for loop becuase it makes the code look cleaner, run better, and its easier to use. since the range is unknown, i know that the first index ([0]) is the serial number so in the for loop i would start at 1 and then i would go to the length of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: You could use a while loop instead of a for loop. You could set the while loop equal to the length of the list and then slowly increase by 1 util you reach the end of the list. I guess the benefit to using a while loop is that you are actually able to see whats happening (makes it easier to read/go through). You are going to have to write out going into the list and checking whats inside, rather than a for loop doing it for you.\n",
